Instructions for setting up:
1) Install pip and virtualenv:
	(http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/#install-osx)
	(we'll be working inside a virtual environment so that everything is
	  standard no matter where we are working)
2) Set up a virtual environment:
	mkdir ~/.virtualenvs
	virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/future
	(don't start the virtual enviroment yet)
3) Install foreman
	3a) install rvm with your package manager.
	3b) reload your shell
		source ~/.bashrc
	3c) Install foreman
		gem install foreman
3) Clone the Git repo:
	3a) set up git:
		http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/
	3b) Clone the repo:
		mkdir [dir_for_project]
		git clone https://github.com/jsnydes/future
4) Enter virtual environment, and install dependencies:
	source ~/.virtualenvs/future/bin/activate
		(you will see '(future)' prepended to your prompt)
	cd [dir_for_project]
	pip install -r requirements.txt
5) test that everything worked...
	foreman start
	(you should see no error messages)
	(go to localhost:5000 in browser to see site.)

That's it!  Everything is set up in your virtual environment.  Whenever you want
to work in the environment again, just do:

'source ~/.virtualenvs/future/bin/activate'

and everything will be there.
